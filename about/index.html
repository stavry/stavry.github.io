<h1 id="hello-and-welcome-to-stavry">Hello and welcome to stavry!</h1>
<p><code>stavry</code> is short for Sriva<code>stav</code>a + Grego<code>ry</code>, named after the creators of this site: <strong>Aditya Srivastava and Rachel Gregory</strong>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re partners who realized in December 2021 that we wanted a new project to work on. 2021 was a year full of voracious reading for both of us, which eventually made us want to write. We started thinking about how we would want to explore this new interest&ndash; technical blogs? novels? short stories? non fiction? &ndash; and settled on why not all of the above? A joint website where we could write about the things we do, create, and consume seemed to be the perfect project.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Aditya started eagerly perusing Berkeley (our alma mater)&rsquo;s course catalog to look for subjects he wanted to explore while in school, but didn&rsquo;t have the bandwidth for while completing a double major in Computer Sciece and Molecular &amp; Cellular Biology. The list started getting long because there&rsquo;s so much awesome stuff to learn out there! So, we decided to add a page for learning so that we can keep track of learning resources for each subject we want to study.</p>

<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m a software engineer who works on core infrastructure at DoorDash. I&rsquo;m originally from Nashville, but have lived in the Bay Area since 2017.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had a lot of different things I was interested in now that I think about it. As a kid I sang, read, wrote, danced, and played basketball. In middle school, I dropped dance to try basically every sport I could: soccer, cheerleading, basketball, softball, cross country, track. Then in high school, I dropped all those stressful team sports and narrowed it down to cross country and track. But all throughout, singing and writing never left.</p>
<p>In college, I struggled a lot with having enough time to do all the things I wanted to, because most of my time was spent on Computer Science, Linguistics, Chinese, and working a part-time job. I sang for one year with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51WBQ7mKvj4&amp;t=1s">an a capella group on campus</a>, but eventually had to leave that because of the time commitment.</p>
<p>So after I graduated in December 2020, I knew I needed to reconnect with those parts of me that I had neglected for a few years. I slowly started exercising again, reading again, exploring new music, and always looked to learn something new without any performance pressure. It was beautiful and healing and I&rsquo;m thankful that I&rsquo;ve been able to carry that energy with me as I started work this past August.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m focusing on&hellip;<br>
<strong>art</strong>: crocheting, writing<br>
<strong>learning</strong>: reading, Hindi<br>
<strong>athletics</strong>: rock climbing, running</p>
<p>In the next year or so, I hope to make headway on my novel, crochet a sweater, read a lot of awesome books, gain elementary proficiency in Hindi, run a 5k in less than 25 minutes, and be able to send most V5s I encounter.</p>
<p>But I also really like&hellip;<br>
<strong>art</strong>: singing, piano, drawing, watercoloring<br>
<strong>learning</strong>: languages, practicing my Chinese (decently proficient), sociology, film, computer systems, science in general <br>
<strong>athletics</strong>: hiking, badmintion, frisbee, cycling</p>

<p>Pretty much like Rachel, I love learning lots of different things!</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m focusing on&hellip;<br>
<strong>art</strong>: writing <br>
<strong>learning</strong>: reading literature, law, computer science research <br>
<strong>athletics</strong>: rock climbing, running</p>
